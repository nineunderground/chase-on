COMPONENTS
----------
- 1 Game board: 14 spots in a CIRCLE (after spot 14, next is spot 1)

  * 6x Double Agent (-1, 6, -1)
  * 6x Enforcer (1, 2, 3)

  * 1x Mole (-3) - single value only
- Advanced cards (NOT used in this version)

SIMPLE MODE SETUP
-----------------
1. Place the board with the simple side facing up
2. Each player picks a color and places their meeple on their home space
3. Shuffle all 38 agent cards
4. Deal 4 cards face-down to each player
5. Place remaining cards as a face-down draw pile
6. Starting player: whoever last watched a spy movie

TURN STRUCTURE (Play > Recruit > End)
-------------------------------------

PLAY PHASE:
- Play 2 cards from your hand with DIFFERENT names
- Place 1 card face-up and 1 card face-down
- Optional: Before playing, you may discard your entire hand and draw 4 new cards
  (Each player may do this up to 4 times total per game)
- After playing, draw back up to 4 cards

RECRUIT PHASE:
- Your opponent looks at both cards (including the face-down one)
- Opponent chooses 1 card to recruit (place face-up in front of them)
- You recruit the remaining card (place face-up in front of you)

END PHASE:
- Both players move their meeples based on recruited cards
- Movement is determined by the card's icon AND how many copies you have:
  * 1 copy of that agent: Use the 1st movement value
  * 2 copies: Use the 2nd movement value
  * 3+ copies: Use the 3rd movement value
- Check for win/loss conditions

MOVEMENT
--------
Each agent card shows 3 movement values. The value you use depends on your collection:
- Having 1 copy → Use leftmost (1st) value
- Having 2 copies → Use middle (2nd) value
- Having 3+ copies → Use rightmost (3rd) value

Positive numbers: Move toward opponent
Negative numbers: Move away from opponent (backward)
Zero: Don't move

AGENT CARDS (38 total)
----------------------
Format: (1st copy, 2nd copy, 3rd+ copy)

DOUBLE AGENT (6 cards)
- Movement: -1 / 6 / -1
- Risky! 1st goes back, 2nd is huge leap, 3rd+ goes back again

ENFORCER (6 cards)
- Movement: 1 / 2 / 3
- Steady, reliable forward progression

CODEBREAKER (6 cards)
- Movement: 0 / 0 / WIN
- No movement, but collect 3 = INSTANT WIN!

SABOTEUR (6 cards)
- Movement: -1 / -1 / -2
- Always moves backward! Tactical retreat card

DAREDEVIL (6 cards)
- Movement: 2 / 3 / LOSE
- Fast forward movement, but collect 3 = INSTANT LOSS!

SENTINEL (6 cards)
- Movement: 0 / 2 / 6
- Defensive early, powerful when collected

SIDEKICK (1 card)
- Movement: 4 (single value - always 4)
- Unique card, consistent movement

MOLE (1 card)
- Movement: -3 (single value - always -3)
- Unique card, always moves backward

WIN CONDITIONS
--------------
You WIN if:
1. Your meeple catches (lands on or passes) your opponent's meeple
2. You collect 3 Codebreaker cards
3. Your opponent collects 3 Daredevil cards

LOSE CONDITIONS
---------------
You LOSE if:
1. Your opponent's meeple catches yours
2. Your opponent collects 3 Codebreakers
3. You collect 3 Daredevil cards

DECK DEPLETION
--------------
If the deck runs out and a player has fewer than 2 cards to play:
- The player closest to catching their opponent wins
- Ties go to the active player (whose turn it is)

ADVANCED MODE
-------------
Use the board side with black market corners.

Setup changes:
- Shuffle the 15 black market cards separately
- Place 3 face-up as a supply, rest as draw pile

During play:
- If you land EXACTLY on a black market space after moving, take 1 supply card
- Replace taken card from the black market draw pile
- Card types:
  * INSTANT: Resolve immediately, then discard
  * ONGOING: Keep in play for continued effects
- If both players land on black market spaces, active player resolves first

TEAM VARIANT (3-4 Players)
--------------------------
- Form teams of 2 players (or 2 vs 1 in 3-player)
- Each team shares 1 meeple and played cards
- Team members agree on play order
- One teammate plays face-up card, other plays face-down card
- Cards must have different names
- Opponents choose which team gets which card
- Discard limit: 2 per player (4 total for solo player in 3-player game)

STRATEGY TIPS
-------------
1. Bluffing: The face-down card creates mind games. What does your opponent want?
2. Codebreakers: Valuable but obvious - opponents will try to take them
3. Daredevils: Fast but risky - can backfire if you collect too many
4. Set building: More copies = more movement, plan your collections
5. Watch opponent's collection to predict their choices
