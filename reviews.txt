Compiled for game development reference

OVERVIEW FROM REVIEWS
---------------------
Agent Avenue is a highly praised 2-player bluffing and set-collection card game from 
Nerdlab Games (the Mindbug publisher). Players are undercover animal spies on the same 
suburban street, racing to catch each other using a unique "I split, you choose" mechanic.

Age: 8+

THEMATIC ELEMENTS
-----------------
- 1950s anthropomorphic animal spy theme
- Charming artwork by Fanny Pastor-Berlie with unique poses per card
- Quirky suburban street setting ("Agent Avenue")
- Light theme - gameplay over narrative

CORE GAMEPLAY HIGHLIGHTS
------------------------
The "I split, you choose" mechanic creates intense psychological tension:
- Active player plays one card face-up and one face-down
- Opponent picks which card they want
- Active player gets the remaining card
- Cards move your marker based on set collection size

Movement scaling is key:
- First copy of an agent type: smaller movement
- Second copy: medium movement  
- Third+ copies: larger movement (or special effects)

WIN CONDITIONS (from reviews):
- Land on or pass opponent's meeple position
- Collect three Codebreakers
- Force opponent to collect three Daredevils

ADVANCED MODE:
- Black Market cards add asymmetry and surprise abilities

REVIEW #1 - "Two Spies One Street"
----------------------------------
Source: BoardGameGeek
Rating: 8/10

THEME:
An anthropomorphic world where you play as a spy trying to unmask an enemy spy.
Be faster and smarter than your opponent to win.

GAMEPLAY SUMMARY:
- Play two cards from hand to move around the game board
- Place one card face-down, one face-up (opponent sees one)
- Opponent chooses one of the two cards to take
- Cards show movement steps (positive moves forward, negative moves back!)
- Crucial to think carefully about card plays
- Bluffing is key - or avoiding opponent's double bluff
- Can exchange cards from hand with draw pile (4 times per game)
- Helps remove bad cards without giving them to opponent

CARD VARIETY:
- Many different card types making choices difficult
- Some cards: win or lose immediately if you play a third of the same suit
- Must be careful not to let opponent get "easy" victory

GAME MECHANICS NOTED:
1. "I split, you choose" - reveal two cards, opponent picks one, you get other
2. Hand management - track cards, play them, or discard strategically
3. Race element - thematic component with comical cartoon spies chasing each other
4. Set collection - collect sets to take more steps per card

REVIEWER'S OPINION:

STRENGTHS:
+ Quick to learn, plays smoothly
+ Beautiful anthropomorphic character illustrations (comic book vibe)
+ Game board is nice addition to card game
+ Components beautifully designed and good quality
+ Black market option adds difficulty and interest
+ Easy to play rematch immediately

WEAKNESSES:
- Primarily 2-player (harder to bring to larger game nights)
- Base game a bit too easy without black market cards
- (Minor drawbacks that don't prevent replay)

CONCLUSION:
"Fantastic game that plays smoothly and is easy to learn. Highly recommend to
anyone who enjoys or frequently plays 2-player games. Every opportunity I get
to play this game, I'll seize it for a good round of Agent Avenue."

FINAL SCORE: 8/10
